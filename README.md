# Merge_Sort_and_Binary_Search_Algorithms
Basic algorithms emplementation

In this particular project, a .csv file is uploaded in Java through csvFiletoJava class for further manupulations.

In addition Merge sort and binary search algorithms are implemented in the ProbabilityCalculation_Project class to find how many numbers are less than or equal to a specified value within the given .csv file . The probability to find an error less than or equal to the specified number in the given set of data is computed.
